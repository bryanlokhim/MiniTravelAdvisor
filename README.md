MiniTravelBuddy is an AI-powered travel recommendation tool built with **LangChain** and **Chroma DB**. It processes natural language inputs (e.g., "budget beach trip") and recommends destinations from a curated dataset using vector-based search. This compact project, training my skills in modern AI tools for software engineering and AI/ML development field.


Please note that this is a small, personal project practicing my technical abilities in the LLm frameworks. Contributions and feedback are welcome! 🚀
